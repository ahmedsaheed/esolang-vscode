# Esolang VSCode Support

Provides syntax highlighting for esolang in VSCode.
Todo: Add LSP support for esolang - this will allow for better autocompletion and error checking.

## Hacking on the extension

-   Run `npm run compile-watch` in a terminal
-   Run debug 'launch client', which opens a new VScode instance
-   Open an esolang file in the new VScode instance
